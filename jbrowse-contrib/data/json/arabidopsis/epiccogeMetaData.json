            "Processing Description": "We used Perl scripts to convert all the Cs in the reads (and in the scaffolds) to Ts, and aligned the converted reads to the converted reference scaffold, allowing up to two mismatches per read. 76 base reads were divided into the first 45 and the last 31 bases, 100 base reads were divided in half and 50 base reads were processed as single reads. Each half of the read was aligned independently using bowtie, allowing up to two mismatches. The coordinates of the two halves were subsequently correlated; the second half was discarded if it did not match the first. Single_C: We used Perl scripts to recover the original sequence of each mapped read and, for each C (on either strand), count the number of times it was sequenced as a C or a T. 50bp_window: We used a Perl script to calculate fractional methylation (#C/(#C+#T)) within a 50 bp sliding window for each sequence context (CG, CHG, CHH). All files are in GFF format. Files contain fractional methylation data either for individual cytosines (single-c) or in 50 bp windows.",
